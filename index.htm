    <h3>COFFEE IS THE BEST</h3>

        <p>
            Coffee has taken an important place in human society
            for at least 1200 years. Its consumption, which
            probably originated in northeast Africa, spread 
            out to the Middle East in the 15th century and 
            thence to Europe. After oil, coffee has become 
            the second most valuable commodity around the 
            world. Today, coffee is among the most widely 
            consumed pharmacologically active beverages, 
            and its consumption has become a regular part of
            daily life worldwide. It is estimated that more 
            than half of Americans drink coffee every day. 
            The average consumption for a person in the 
            European Community is 5.1 kg/year, which is 
            similar to that in the United States.1

            In fact, coffee is a complex mixture of chemicals, 
            and is the main source of caffeine in many 
            populations. However, it also contains thousands 
            of different chemicals, including carbohydrates, 
            lipids, nitrogenous compounds, vitamins, minerals, 
            alkaloids, and phenolic compounds.
